Sales Prediction through Advertisement
Overview
Welcome to our sales prediction project! This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict sales based on advertising spend. By analyzing historical data on advertising expenditure across different channels and corresponding sales figures, our model aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of various advertising mediums and predict future sales outcomes.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast sales based on advertising expenses. This enables businesses to optimize their advertising budgets, allocate resources effectively, and maximize the return on investment (ROI) from their marketing campaigns.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn (for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization)
Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE for running the code
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
